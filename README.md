Sqlite3_For_Blockchain_Data_Analytics

This project demonstrates how SQLite3 can be used to store, query, and analyze blockchain data efficiently in the context of data analytics. It is part of a broader initiative to explore and apply data science techniques in the Web3 ecosystem.

ðŸ“Œ Project Objective

To showcase the integration of on-chain blockchain data with a lightweight relational database system (SQLite3), enabling structured querying and analysis using SQL for insight generation.

ðŸ“‚ Whatâ€™s Inside

- Python scripts for:
  - Creating and managing SQLite3 databases.
  - Inserting raw blockchain data (from APIs).
  - Performing SQL queries for insights.
- Example data includes simulated transaction data from Ethereum-based tokens.
- Use cases such as:
  - Identifying top transacting wallets.
  - Summarizing transfer volumes.

ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- Python
- SQLite3
- Pandas
